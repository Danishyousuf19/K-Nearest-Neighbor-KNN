# My Machine Learning Projects 
## Using K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN)


This repository contains machine learning projects focused on various prediction tasks using K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) technique. Each project includes the dataset, a Jupyter notebook with the analysis and model implementation.

## Projects
 
1. **Breast Cancer Detection**
   - **Description**: This project uses a dataset ofBreast Cancer  to predict whether a women have Breast Cancer or not based on various factors.


## Getting Started

To run the projects locally, clone the repository and navigate to the respective project folder. Open the Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb` file) to see the analysis and model implementation.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Danishyousuf19/K-Nearest-Neighbor-KNN.git
